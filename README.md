# Simple inventory ingredients management

Trying to do an inventory using nodeJs, express and mongoose.

Using react for front.

# TODO List

## Front end
- fix front end, listing items work, but nothing else. (tried to copy paste old stuffs that were weird, need to redo it completly and clean)
- unit tests with jest
- E2E tests with testcafe

## Back end
- Add unit type
- Add category
- unit tests with mocha and chai
- bonus : add image

Need to fix front end first before going any further on back end.
