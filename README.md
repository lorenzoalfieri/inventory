# Simple inventory management

Trying to do an inventory using nodeJs, express and mongoose.

Using react for front.

# How to use it

Go in the server folder, and use yarn and yarn start. If you want to use your custom mongoDB link u can add it in app.js

Then open an other terminal and do the same with client.

# Possible upgrade

## Back end
- Add category
- handle image of products

## Front end
- Add more reactive feature (ex: click on name to modify, arrow to add or remove quantity)
